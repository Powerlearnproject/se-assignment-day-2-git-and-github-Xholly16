2. Flexibility: Branches enable teams to work on multiple features or tasks concurrently, improving overall productivity.
3. Risk reduction: Branches allow for experimentation and testing without affecting the main codebase.

Creating a Branch
1. *Use the git branch command*: Create a new branch using git branch <branch-name>.
2. Switch to the new branch: Use git checkout <branch-name> to switch to the newly created branch.

Using a Branch
1. Make changes: Work on your feature or bug fix, making changes as needed.
2. Commit changes: Regularly commit your changes using git add and git commit.
3. Push changes: Push your changes to the remote repository using git push origin <branch-name>.

Merging a Branch
1. Switch to the target branch: Use git checkout <target-branch> to switch to the branch you want to merge into.
2. Merge the branch: Use git merge <branch-name> to merge the changes from the feature branch into the target branch.
3. Resolve conflicts: If conflicts arise, resolve them manually and commit the changes.
4. Push the updated branch: Push the updated branch to the remote repository using git push origin <target-branch>.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
